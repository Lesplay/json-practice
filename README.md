# json-practice

A practical exercise with the use of http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

The aim of this is to write a function that will create an automatic download of users with some tricky limitations.

The limitations introduced here are as follows: 
  - Users are limited by their zipcode - it has to follow given rules (XXXXX-XXXX, where X is a number)
  - The Users have uploaded at least one image that contains a certain word/expression ('voluptate' in this case)
  
I decided to tackle it using 100% javascript. Also wanted to make it as changeable as possible.
